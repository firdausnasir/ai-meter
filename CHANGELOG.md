## [1.26.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added

- Provider Drag-to-Reorder — customize tab order via up/down buttons in Settings → Display
  - Tab enum refactored from hardcoded to data-driven with `@AppStorage("providerTabOrder")`
  - TabBarView, dropdown menu, and keyboard navigation all follow the stored order
  - `decodedProviderOrder` handles missing/corrupt values gracefully

## [1.25.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added

- Session Depleted/Restored Notifications — alerts when any provider's quota hits 0% and when it recovers
  - New `SessionQuotaTracker` state machine tracking normal/depleted transitions per provider
  - Integrated into Claude, Copilot, Codex, and GLM services (Kimi skipped — balance-based)
  - Respects existing `notificationsEnabled` toggle
  - Fires each notification only once per transition (no spam)

## [1.24.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added

- Personal Info Redaction — toggle in Settings (Accounts section) to hide emails and org names throughout the UI
  - New `PersonalInfoRedactor` utility with regex-based email detection and whole-identity field replacement
  - Applied to Claude org name and Codex email displays in settings
  - "Reset to Defaults" also resets the redaction toggle

## [1.23.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- Monthly Recap — Spotify Wrapped-style usage summary with scrollable card UI in a dedicated window
  - Claude stats: average/peak session & weekly utilization, plan name, peak date
  - Copilot stats: chat, completions, premium utilization with progress bars
  - Highlights card with power user badge (avg > 70%)
  - Shareable PNG export (1080×1920) via native share sheet
  - Auto-generates on 1st of month with notification, also accessible from settings
- Settings Window — dedicated sidebar settings window (Cmd+, to open)
  - Sidebar navigation: Accounts, Display, Notifications, Shortcuts, General
  - Replaces inline settings in popover for more room
- Debug tools (#if DEBUG) — test buttons for recap window and notifications
- RecapService with monthly aggregation, persistence (~/.config/aimeter/recaps/), and auto-trigger

### Changed

- History retention extended from 7 to 31 days (required for monthly recaps)
- Notifications now use osascript backend (fixes delivery for ad-hoc signed builds)
- Settings tab (Cmd+6 / gear icon) now opens the settings window instead of inline view
- Added Cmd+, keyboard shortcut to open settings

### Fixed

## [1.20.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added

- Dropdown navigation menu uses small icon variants for all providers
- Settings page wrapped in ScrollView (max 500px) to prevent content clipping on smaller displays
