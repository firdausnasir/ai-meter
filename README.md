# AIMeter

A native macOS menu bar app and WidgetKit widgets for monitoring Claude API usage and rate limits.

---

## Overview

AIMeter sits in your menu bar and shows your Claude API usage at a glance — session (5h), weekly (7d), Sonnet-specific, and extra credits. It reads your existing Claude Code authentication token from the macOS Keychain, so there is no separate login required.

---

## Features

- Menu bar icon with a color-coded circular gauge reflecting your highest active utilization
- Popover with per-limit progress bars, reset times, and extra credits balance
- WidgetKit extension with small (single gauge) and medium (all gauges) widget sizes
- Automatic API polling with a configurable refresh interval (30s, 60s, 120s)
- Color thresholds: green below 50%, yellow 50-79%, red 80% and above
- Reset times displayed in your configured timezone
- No Dock icon — runs as a background agent (`LSUIElement`)
- Reads OAuth token from the macOS Keychain (Claude Code credentials) — read-only, no writes
- Graceful error states: stale-data indicator when the API is unreachable, hint when no token is found
- Launch at login via `SMAppService`

## Screenshots

Coming soon.

## Requirements

- macOS 14.0 (Sonoma) or later
- Xcode 16.0 or later
- [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) for project generation
- Claude Code installed and authenticated (provides the Keychain credential)

---

## Install (Pre-built)

1. Download the latest `AIMeter-vX.X.X.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/Khairul989/ai-meter/releases/latest)
2. Unzip and move `AIMeter.app` to `/Applications`
3. **First launch only:** right-click the app -> "Open" (bypasses Gatekeeper for unsigned apps)
4. AIMeter appears in your menu bar

Updates are checked automatically on launch. You can also check manually via Settings -> "Check for Updates..."

---

## Build from Source

1. Clone the repo
2. `cd AIMeter && xcodegen generate`
3. Open `AIMeter.xcodeproj` in Xcode and run

---

## Configuration

Open the popover from the menu bar icon and click the settings gear in the bottom-right corner.

| Setting | Options | Default |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Refresh interval | 30s, 60s, 120s | 60s |
| Timezone | Common timezone list | System timezone |
| Launch at login | On / Off | Off |

## How It Works

```
AIMeter.app (LSUIElement — no Dock icon)
  |
  |-- UsageService (timer-based polling)
  |     Reads OAuth token from Keychain (Claude Code-credentials)
  |     Calls https://api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage
  |     Writes UsageData JSON to App Group UserDefaults
  |     Triggers WidgetCenter.shared.reloadAllTimelines()
  |
  |-- MenuBar Popover (SwiftUI)
        Reads from UsageService @Published state

App Group: group.com.khairul.aimeter
  |
  +-- AIMeterWidget extension (WidgetKit)
        TimelineProvider reads UsageData from App Group UserDefaults
        Small widget: highest-utilization gauge
        Medium widget: all gauges side by side
```

- **Authentication** — `KeychainHelper` uses `SecItemCopyMatching` to read the token stored by Claude Code. It is strictly read-only.
- **API** — `GET https://api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage` with `anthropic-beta: oauth-2025-04-20` header.
- **Shared state** — `UserDefaults(suiteName:)` with an App Group bridges the main app and the widget extension. The widget never makes its own network requests.

## Roadmap

- **Notifications** — alert when utilization crosses configurable thresholds (planned for v2)
- **Additional providers** — GitHub Copilot, OpenAI Codex usage monitoring
- **Historical charts** — usage trends over time
- **Multiple accounts** — support for switching between Claude accounts
